              <h3>
                With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
              </h3>
              <p>
                Uncle Ben, from our favorite Spiderman series said, with great power comes great responsibility. During high school, as a student deeply interested in statistics, I happened to come across the Pareto Rule – or more popularly known as the 80/20 rule, which states that for many observations and events, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. And it holds true with no mathematical derivation to back it up. I doubt even Andrew Wiles could devote his entire life solving this simple observation and find a solution, like he did with Fermat’s last theorem. I was intrigued, and after follow-up readings, the examples were everywhere. For instance, 80% of the sales come from 20% of the clients. But most importantly, we have the richest 20% of the world's population controlling almost 80% of the world's income. So why don’t draw the conclusion that 20% of the people are in control of the decisions affecting 80% of the world. The reality is, it’s far less than 20%. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Mahatma Gandhi famously said – “There is enough on Earth for everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.” This is true now more than ever, as we have the people who are at positions of leadership, positions of control who are making decisions in greed. It would seem as if everybody other than yourself is in control of your destiny.

              <h3>
                The Politics of Climate Change 
              </h3>
              <p>
                President of USA, the largest economy in the world, doesn’t even believe in climate change. Trump has long expressed skepticism about global warming, climate change, and, more specifically, the melting of ice caps. “East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record,” he tweeted during record snowfalls in December. “Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!” Two years earlier, he suggested that climate change was a hoax “created by and for the Chinese” to make the U.S. uncompetitive. All this would be great if he were just another random social media user who was ranting. Not okay if the same person in Donald Trump. He is in position of power, in control of the world’s largest economy. India was one of the first countries to sign the Paris Climate Accord. The Paris climate accord, however, would have led to “lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production,” Trump insisted, defending his decision to withdraw the United States from the historic international agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Narendra Modi, who is the Prime Minister of India, was originally extremely passionate about working for climate change. In fact as chief minister of Gujarat, he was the first one to have a department in the government dedicated solely to addressing growing climate change, recently declared that it is not the climate but the people who have changed.

              <h3>
                Technology – Boon or Bane? 
              </h3>
              <p>
                Dan Brown’s most recent crime thriller Origin, focuses on the exact topic of the growing synergy between technology and humankind, which helped me view the growing advancements in technology with a different perspective. Why do we make movies which predict the end of humanity, where there is an alternative scenario of co-existence? A future where technology becomes so inexpensive and ubiquitous that it erases the gap between have and have-nots. A future where environmental technology provides billions of people with drinking water, nutritious food, and access to clean energy. A future where cancer is eradicated using genomic medicine. A future where assembly line robotics frees workers from mind-numbing jobs, so they can pursue more rewarding fields in areas not yet imagined. Above all, a future in which breakthrough technologies begin such an abundance of humankind’s critical resources that warring over them is no longer necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                  But you can’t have heads without the possibility of a tails. The other side of the coin paints a bleak picture of the future. Technology is already putting many out of jobs. Workers are having to continuously find new jobs. With the speed at which technology is advancing, systems and machines are becoming obsolete faster than ever. This is generating more E-waste than ever before, and it is only going to continuously and exponentially grow. Mobiles are just an extension of our hand, our connection to the rest of the world, and without it we feel empty and hollow and life seems meaningless. The technological nirvana being shown to us by artificial intelligence, machine learning and robots seems unbelievable, but will it really make us happy? According to the latest World Happiness Report, US and UK, the economies at the center of the startup action, rank 17th and 18th on the list. But the truth remains, money can’t buy happiness. The level of synergy between human and technology would depend on the humans in charge of programming and automation of the machines.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I came across an enlightening article on Mark Zuckerberg, amidst demands for deletion of Facebook on grounds of not protecting its’ user’s data. Many believe Zuckerberg’s evident dereliction of responsibility played a key role in ushering in not just the Trump presidency, but also a toxic hellscape of media mistrust and a damaged democracy. We have seen that billionaires don’t really make good Presidents. That Mark Zuckerberg plans to do so is appalling, as he has held no office, and has no record of good judgement or character. Though we would like to believe we are our own canvas and our own painter. Not true now, since we are influenced from all angles and means possible, and with lack of an effective media, faced with twisted facts that we by no means have resources to verify.

                Humans and our Need for Groupism 
              </h3>
              <p>
                There is a generation gap between me and my mom. We have an age difference of 30 years. There is also a generation gap between me and my brother. We are separated by just 7 years. And age is just a number, they claimed. The world marches on ahead faster than ever, destroying everything in its path. Would the machines we make, protect us from us by destroying us? My mind says no since we humans are rational and have an instinct of self-preservation, but my heart knows the truth, since there always exist those who wish to misuse inventions and claim they have nothing to lose. Stephen Hawking said that humans would be destroyed by nuclear war, catastrophic global warming or a genetically engineered virus. He claimed the only solution we have is to colonize another planet, which he believed will take more than a century. But why? We already have Elon Musk pioneering path breaking research into tesla and SpaceX in a move to colonize Mars. In these times, it is impossible to put a time limit to any achievement since the technological revolution is exponentially growing. My essay is named so after reading Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller SAPIENS, a brief history of humankind, which focuses on the evolution of humanity, and fact that the only constant in life is growth, and that for better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy is growing like a hormone-soused teenager. And it shows immediate no signs of stopping. The same school of thought prevented Albert Einstein from receiving the Nobel Prize for his famous mass-energy relation, because someone chose to use it to make the atomic bomb. He said, “Not everything that counts can be counted. Not everything that can be counted counts.” The last white rhino died last week. The white rhinos are extinct. They survived millions of years on the Earth but couldn’t survive mankind.

                  In a course I took on environmental economics, I was introduced to Wangari Maathai, the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace. She said that people in power are in control of what happens at the grassroots. Everything’s trickling down. But what if it trickled upwards? What if you had communities of farmers who influenced the world. Because the people at the top, they have control of the resources, they have power, they have a lot of privileges, they can continue to increase these privileges from where they sit and the public at the grassroot can continue to suffer. The top is very heavy and changing the top is very difficult and changing the top if you don’t have the grassroot is almost impossible. The greenbelt movement she initiated was a holistic approach to counter poverty and environmental conservation. It went from the grassroot and said maybe instead of the trickle down, there should be a trickle up. Once there are a few farmers part of the movement before you know it expands to many. She was poor and opposed by her own government and she continued her work and persevered. She is an inspiration for us to find a solution to a pressing problem and work towards it no matter the obstacles, the opposition. Collaboration, that is teamwork, she says is of utmost importance, because you do not want your work to die with you.
              </p>
              <p> 
                  People are aware that there is climate change, need for sustainable development, need to find alternative natural resources. But just being aware does not solve the problem, It’s much more complex. It’s how an individual interprets a problem and his attitude towards the problem, which defines the direction and ultimately his solution. Amartya Sen, another Nobel prize winner on economic sciences put this in better words, you need a good description, for a good prescription. John Nash, a mathematician famous for the game theory concept of Nash equilibrium, states why Adam Smith’s theory of everyman for himself was wrong and why, if we chose what is best for the group, it would end up being the best for every individual as well. The Nash equilibrium helps economists understand how decisions that are good for the individual can be terrible for the group. This tragedy of the commons explains why we overfish the seas, and why we emit too much carbon into the atmosphere. Everyone would be better off if only we could agree to show some restraint. But given what everyone else is doing, fishing or gas-guzzling makes individual sense. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  The conclusion remains that humans are progressing at a supersonic speed, but we have survived despite having n number of generations predict the end of humankind, I believe we will emerge victorious and pave way for a better world.
