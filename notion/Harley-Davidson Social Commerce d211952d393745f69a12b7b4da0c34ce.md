## Brief

Harley Davidson’s ecommerce team wishes to answer the following question “**How might we increase product purchase beyond motorcycles during the consumers’ social sessions and grow the H-D community?”** The team worked on identifying messaging, growth channels and give recommendations that can be tried and tested.

## Process

- Use **social media listening tool** to model behaviours of the current followers of the Harley-Davidson channels across different platforms.
- Understand the current consumer journey to distinguishing between reaching through organic social media and paid media conversions

## Insights

- Using the analytics tool showed how specific events increase H-D mentions (3100% increase in mentions due to Jungkook from BTS wearing a H-D jacket).

- It is important to build the H-D persona just how Dickies and Carhartt have nailed engagement with their followers.

- Harley-Davidson’s lack of presence on platforms like Reddit and TikTok have been hurting it as competitors maintain their channel pushing users from exploring to buying.

- Comparing the content styles of Harley-Davidson with top competitors like Indian Motorcycle, BMW and Triumph makes us realize we need to push more images across platforms.

- **Shop the Look** and **Shop the Product**: My recommendations for ad designs on existing media platforms (Facebook and Instagram) were well-received and guided future Ad designs.

## Process

**Existing Solutions**

GrooveSync uses the liked song playlist of the users in a group and evaluates the compatibility of other songs and playlists to the group and recommends songs that everyone can enjoy together

**Execution**

- As a team we combined all our liked songs playlists and matched it with the music factors that Spotify uses in their current algorithm.
- EDA: To understand the data better, identify outliers and see correlations.
- We used methods like Gaussian Mixture Models clustering, custom clustering and NeighbourAssess to generate that smart playlist.
- We then used the algorithm on the Top 100 playslist to see if it can sleect songs that all the members on the team could vibe to.

## Reflections

- Different channels have different customer and user profiles, it is important to identify the ideal platforms for products being sold.
- As the team and number of stakeholders grow, **project management** becomes increasingly complex.
- **Competitive analysis** can be tedious with multiple details but will build a strong foundation of research to push for action.
