## Process

The solution was built by going through the new product development process. It consisted of multiple phases - Discovery, Research, Design and Prototyping.

- **Discovery** Understanding the current landscape of the market through PESTLE analysis, affinity diagramming, stakeholder mapping, positioning map, concept diagram.
- **Research** Deep dive into the problem space and conductive primary and secondary research to understand the core problems by listening to social chatter, conducting patient and physician interviews, attending webinars, and more.
- **Design** Brainstorming solutions which build upon the research and identifying parameters to evaluate success like creative matrix, round robin brainstorming.
- **Prototyping** Running buildathons to allow for rapid prototyping, and then running usability testing sessions and incorporating client feedback before the final Hi-fi prototype.

## Insights

- **Psychological Safety:** A critical finding that shaped our thinking was how large a role psychological safety played into the definition of quality of life for those living with COPD. It was insightful learning about the interplay between psychological safety, and other indicators of a quality life.

- **Brainstorming:** Wrote the problem statement on the board and that was the space we ideated in. So keeping our learnings and requirements on a backburner we did quick brainstorming sessions, which involved sketching out 8 ideas in 8 minutes.

- **User Feedback:** Using Facebook was the way to reach people with COPD and engaging them to understand if the proposed solution could be integrated into their daily lives easily and have value.

## Solution

The final solution was a community-centric mobile application which encouraged communication between clinicians, patients and others with COPD. 

- It provided **access to resources** and encouraged daily routine building through customized to-do lists and buddy groups.
- Concept of **buddy groups**, which would be an intimate group of 6 members that would check-in regularly and encourage each other.
- Regular **notifications** prompting action on the to-do list defined through collaboration between physician and patient and allowing progress tracking.

## Reflections

- **Finding the right participants** is key to gathering good data**.** It is important to understand what kind of questions need to be answered to find the right fit.
- **Prototyping** is an underrated phase that done well can give key customer insights that other types of research cannot showcase.
- Getting **continuous feedback** is important for team ownership and stakeholder buy-in in the final solution.
