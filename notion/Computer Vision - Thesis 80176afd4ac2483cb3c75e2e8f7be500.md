Project Description: Image Processing for optimizing the die forging process
My Role: Programmer, Researcher

Morphing is defined as the animated transformation of one image into another in a series of steps. We do it by producing sequence of frames.

Forging die is a method of manufacturing which involves molding of metal into user dened shape using localised compressive forces. There are different types of forging processes included but not limited to Open die forging, Closed die forging, Roll forging, press forging, etc.

The application of image morphing on die forging processes is explored. It is first implemented on publicly available animated images, after which it is implemented on technical drawings. Using image processing techniques, we use the initial and nal image to obtain an image morphed video, following which optical flow techniques are explored for point tracking across frames. Performance results of the image morphings are presented by using Structural Similarity Indices.

Several different triangulation techniques can be used for triangulation of a set
of points. Triangulation of a set of points is a popular process that is done in
computer graphics. Delaunay triangulation is one of the methods for optimal
triangulation of a set of points.

Similarity indices are generally used for image
quality assessment. Computational models are used to measure the image quality
consistently with subjective evaluations.

Current processes of die forging simulation include doing extensive finite element
analysis, knowing forces, defining process parameters and material properties.
