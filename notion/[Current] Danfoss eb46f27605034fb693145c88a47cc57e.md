## Process

**Existing Solutions**

GrooveSync uses the liked song playlist of the users in a group and evaluates the compatibility of other songs and playlists to the group and recommends songs that everyone can enjoy together

**Execution**

- As a team we combined all our liked songs playlists and matched it with the music factors that Spotify uses in their current algorithm.
- EDA: To understand the data better, identify outliers and see correlations.
- We used methods like Gaussian Mixture Models clustering, custom clustering and NeighbourAssess to generate that smart playlist.
- We then used the algorithm on the Top 100 playslist to see if it can sleect songs that all the members on the team could vibe to.

- Working in an interdisciplinary team allowed me to hone my stakeholder management skills and ensure **buy-in for pivotal decisions**
- Frameworks and **processes need to be adapted** to an organization’s culture, usecases and core to get the most from them.
