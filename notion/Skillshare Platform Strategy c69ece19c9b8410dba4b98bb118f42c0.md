- We started by creating an account on Skillshare and role-playing a student who wanted to learn 3D printing. This helped us empathise and understand the user journey in a better manner.
- Conducting competitive analysis, stakeholder mapping, understanding the marketing model and pricing options came next as we benchmarked current performance and started to build strategies to improve the platform experience for everyone involved.

## Results

## Process

**Existing Solutions**

GrooveSync uses the liked song playlist of the users in a group and evaluates the compatibility of other songs and playlists to the group and recommends songs that everyone can enjoy together

**Execution**

- As a team we combined all our liked songs playlists and matched it with the music factors that Spotify uses in their current algorithm.
- EDA: To understand the data better, identify outliers and see correlations.
- We used methods like Gaussian Mixture Models clustering, custom clustering and NeighbourAssess to generate that smart playlist.
- We then used the algorithm on the Top 100 playslist to see if it can sleect songs that all the members on the team could vibe to.

## Reflections

- I love learning, and Skillshare is an undermarketed platform for getting **hands-on practical online education**. I will definitely be spending more time on it.

**Always be cognizant of User’s Mental Models, even if they were established by your competitors.**

While proposed features and designs within platforms should be internally consistent through type, color, icon, etc usage, it is also important to be consistent with what the industry standards are. You need to be differentiated from your competitiors, but careful consideration needs to be given since users mental models become rigid over time and people become resistant to change, even across platforms.
